--This README.md has been created for the purpose of being part of an e-portfolio. It doesn't actually have anything to do with this API.

  This API functions as a dynamic server that allows users to make requests to access and/or manipulate data in the St Paul crime sqlite database. The database contains information on police incidents from 2014-2021. The incidents contain information like date, time, police code, neighborhood number, block, as well as the case number. The database also contains a table on St Paul police codes, which matches a code number to a crime/incident. For example, the code 100 means homicide. The last table the database contains is a list of "neighborhoods" in St Paul, about 17 of them. It links a code that the police use to a more well known name. The API, when running can receive a GET request for each table in full, with the incidents table defaulting to 1000 incidents. The server will then send back a JSON object with all the data in it as a response. The API can also set parameters for the data. In the case of the codes table, you can specify codes that should appear, and only those codes will be returned. The same can be done for the neighborhoods table. The incidents table gets even more specific, allowing for specific date ranges, limits, etc. There is also a PUT and DELETE function, allowing new items to be added to the table, as well as allowing a delete from the table. The API allows for easy access and manipulation of the database.
